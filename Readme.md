🖼️ Image Comparison Web App (Using ORB)
📌 Project Overview
This project is an Image Comparison Web Application that compares two images and checks how similar they are using image processing techniques. It uses feature extraction to identify matching patterns between images.
🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to build a simple and efficient image comparison system that can be used for verification, matching, and quality-checking tasks.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
Streamlit (for web interface)
Pillow (PIL) (for image handling)
⚙️ How It Works
Users upload two images using the Streamlit interface.
Images are loaded and processed using Pillow and OpenCV.
ORB is used to extract key features from both images.
Feature matching is performed to calculate similarity.
The similarity result is displayed to the user.
🚀 Key Features
Simple image upload using Streamlit
Fast feature extraction using ORB
Efficient image similarity comparison
Lightweight and easy-to-use interface
🌍 Real-World Applications
Image verification
Duplicate image detection
Quality inspection
Visual comparison systems
🔮 Future Enhancements
Add similarity percentage score
Support more image formats
Compare multiple images at once
Deploy the app online
📂 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository
Install required libraries
pip install opencv-python streamlit pillow
Run the application
streamlit run app.py
✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how ORB-based feature matching can be used in a Streamlit web app to compare images efficiently and accurately.
